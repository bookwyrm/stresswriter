# Write & Destroy

[Write & Destroy](http://writeanddestroy.com) is a one page web app that allows users to engage in [journal therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_therapy).

> I've been using writing as therapy for the last little while. It's been really effective. But about 95% of the time, I don't want to keep the writing. I just want to "get it out of my system" and then destroy it.

Many therapists recommend that their patients write out their thoughts, feelings, and experiences on paper. These could include past regrets, trauma, or grief that they need to express.

After writing, therapists recommend burning or shredding the paper. Others recommend attaching the paper to a balloon and watching it float away.

I'd like to re-create this experience on the web. I need help with the JavaScript effects. I'd like the user to push a button on the bottom, and have the page burn, shred, or "float away."

If you can help, please submit a PR or a comment.

Cheers,
